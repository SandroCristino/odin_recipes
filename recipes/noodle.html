        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>5 cm piece of ginger</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons low-salt soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 Chinese cabbage</li>
            <li>500 g fresh or frozen broccoli</li>
            <li>250 g medium egg noodles</li>
            <li>200 g mangetout</li>
            <li>4 large free-range eggs</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>hot chilli sauce , to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <p>Step 1 <br>
            Peel the ginger and garlic and finely grate into a large bowl.
        </p>    
        <p>Step 2 <br>
            Add the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and a pinch of black pepper, then mix to make a dressing.
        </p>    
        <p>Step 3 <br>
            Trim and shred the cabbage and put it into a large pan of boiling salted water with the broccoli (cut into florets first, if using fresh) and noodles to cook for around 3 minutes, then add the mangetout for a final minute.        </p>    
        <p>Step 4 <br>
            Drain it all well, then toss in the bowl of dressing.
        </p>    
        <p>Step 5 <br>
            Fry the eggs in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with a lug of olive oil until cooked to your liking (I like mine with a runny yolk).
        </p>
        <p>Step 6 <br>
            Divide the noodles between bowls, pop an egg on top of each one, and serve drizzled with chilli sauce for that all-important added kick.
